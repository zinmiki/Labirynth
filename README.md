contains random labirynth generation and custom sizeable.

There are a few keyboard shortcuts:
- `+` and `-` resize
- `F4` reload or regenerate
- `F6` reduce window - 4 levels
- `F9` take a screenshoot

Debug keys:
- `F8` auto compleate - sometimes it doesn't work
- `F3` add extra branches

## how to run:
to run program first **download** code to your computer, then unpack your zip file:
```
unzip <zip name>
```
if you don't have **python** installed on your pc, 
download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

After installation run:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

```
pip install pygame
```

Finaly, you can run program `main.py` and generate your first maze.
```
python ./main.py
```
## Auto compleate warning
for this to work you need to click `F6` four times to make it the smallest
